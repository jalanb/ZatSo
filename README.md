# ䷃ ZatSo ?

䷃ ZatSo reads [竜TatSu](https://tatsu.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mini-tutorial.html?highlight=objects#object-models) objects, capturing clichés, remembering routines, [alanogising](https://github.com/fargonauts) algorithms to English[-ish](https://github.com/jalanb/pai/blob/master/bin/bai), and [back](https://github.com/jalanb/pysyte/blob/python3/pysyte/bash/git.py#L577).

䷃ ZatSo uses the [pai](https://github.com/jalanb/pai/blob/master/bin/bai) framework (which vaporizes [pym](https://pym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) to provide shells to define increasingly easy and interesting [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)s which apply changes to the [objects](https://tatsu.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mini-tutorial.html?highlight=objects    #object-models), and underlying [code](), in [scripts](https://github.com/jalanb/what), which provide names in the DSLs.

䷃ ZatSo would've probably preferred to just use a [childish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJlV49RDlLE) "Why?" to gain knowledge, but then [竜TatSu](https://tatsu.readthedocs.io/) came along with a much better suggestion.

Sure is

So, this should be published to GitHub

Yeah

> No message. 'Zat so?

No, "Fake it till you make it"
